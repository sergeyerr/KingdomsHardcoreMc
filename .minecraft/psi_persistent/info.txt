This is Psi's Persistent Data directory.
Files stored here are persistent info on what levels each player has gotten to.
The files in here are the same for every instance and modpack you play, they always end up here.
This allows you to skip tutorials on new worlds or even new modpacks.

If you wish to disable this feature, you can turn it off in the Psi config file.
